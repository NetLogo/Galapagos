;;
;; The two particles colliding are self and other-particle, and while the
;; collision is performed from the point of view of self, both particles are
;; modified to reflect its effects. This is somewhat complicated, so I'll
;; give a general outline here:
;;   1. Do initial setup, and determine the heading between particle centers
;;      (call it theta).
;;   2. Convert the representation of the velocity of each particle from
;;      speed/heading to a theta-based vector whose first component is the
;;      particle's speed along theta, and whose second component is the speed
;;      perpendicular to theta.
;;   3. Modify the velocity vectors to reflect the effects of the collision.
;;      This involves:
;;        a. computing the velocity of the center of mass of the whole system
;;           along direction theta
;;        b. updating the along-theta components of the two velocity vectors.
;;   4. Convert from the theta-based vector representation of velocity back to
;;      the usual speed/heading representation for each particle.
;;   5. Perform final cleanup and update derived quantities.

## WHAT IS IT?

This model introduces the behavior of gas particles trapped in a fixed-volume container (such as a bike tire) or free and unbounded.  This model is part of the "Connected Chemistry" curriculum http://ccl.northwestern.edu/curriculum/ConnectedChemistry/ which explore the behavior of gases.

Most of the models in the Connected Chemistry curriculum use the same basic rules for simulating the behavior of gases.  Each model highlights different features of how gas behavior is related to gas particle behavior.

In all of the models, gas particles are assumed to move and to collide, both with each other and with objects such as walls.

In this model, the fixed volume container (represented by a box), can be drawn in different sizes and proportions. The number of particles added to the inside or the outside of the box can be changed by painting particles.  And the rules of particle interactions (do they bounce off the walls? and do they collide with each other?) can be easily turned on and off).

This model helps students become acclimated to the user interface of NetLogo and evaluate modeling assumptions and representations, before they begin more analytical data analysis and mathematical modeling tasks associated with later models.

## HOW IT WORKS

When the COLLIDE? switch is on, the particles are modeled as hard balls with no internal energy except that which is due to their motion.  Collisions between particles are elastic.  When the BOUNCE? switch is on, the particle will then bounce off the wall in an elastic reflection (angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection).

Particles behave according to the following rules:
1. A particle moves in a straight line without changing its speed, unless it collides with another particle or bounces off the wall.
2. Two particles "collide" if COLLIDE switch is on and they find themselves on the same patch (the world is composed of a grid of small squares called patches).
3. A random axis is chosen, as if they are two balls that hit each other and this axis is the line connecting their centers.
4. They exchange momentum and energy along that axis, according to the conservation of momentum and energy.  This calculation is done in the center of mass system.
5. Each turtle is assigned its new velocity, energy, and heading.
6. If a turtle finds itself on or very close to a wall of the container, it "bounces" -- that is, reflects its direction and keeps its same speed.

## HOW TO USE IT

1. Press the SETUP button
2. Press the PLACE-BOX button.  (A small gray dot will be drawn)
3. Click anywhere in the black portion of the WORLD & VIEW and a yellow box will be drawn to make a corner of it where you click.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 to draw different boxes.
6. If there is no yellow box in your model, repeat steps 1-3.
7. Press the PLACE-PARTICLES button.  The button will remain a dark black color.
8. Click anywhere in the WORLD & VIEW to draw in some particles.
9. Press GO/STOP and observe what happens.
10. Turn the COLLIDE? switch off and repeat steps 7-9 and observe the effect.
11. Turn the BOUNCE? switch off and repeat steps 7-9 and observe the effect.

Initial settings:
- NUMBER-OF-PARTICLES-TO-ADD: the number of gas particles in the box when the simulation starts.

Monitors:
- CLOCK: the number of times the go procedure has been run
- NUMBER: the number of particles in the box

## THINGS TO NOTICE

Can you observe collisions with the walls as they happen (you can pendown a particle or slow down the model)?  For example, do the particles change their color?  Direction?

In what ways is this model a correct idealization of kinetic molecular theory (KMT)?

In what ways is this model an incorrect idealization of the real world?

## THINGS TO TRY

Turn the COLLIDE? switch off and repeat steps 7-9 and observe the effects.
Turn the BOUNCE? switch off and repeat steps 7-9 and observe the effects.

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Can you "puncture" the box, so that particles will escape?

What would happen if the box were heated?  How would the particles behave?  How would this affect the pressure?  Add a slider and code that increases the temperature inside the box.

If you could change the shape of the box, so that the volume remains the same: Does the shape of the box make a difference in the way the particles behave, or the values of pressure?

## NETLOGO FEATURES

The Connected Chemistry models include invisible dark particles (the "dark-particles" breed), which only interact with each other and the walls of the yellow box. The inclusion of dark particles ensures that the speed of simulation remains constant, regardless of the number of particles visible in the simulation.

For example, if a model is limited to a maximum of 400 particles, then when there are 10 visible particles, there are 390 dark particles and when there are 400 visible particles, there are 0 dark particles.  The total number of particles in both cases remains 400, and the computational load of calculating what each of these particles does (collides, bounces, etc...) is close to the same.  Without dark particles, it would seem that small numbers of particles are faster than large numbers of particles -- when in reality, it is simply a reflection of the computational load.  Such behavior would encourage student misconceptions related to particle behavior.
