### ABOUT THIS FILE
###

# This file is used by notarize.scala (usually run from release.sh) to
# attach copyright notices to the procedures and/or info tabs of
# models.
#
# Every model included in an external release must have an entry
# here.  If any models are missing, notarize.scala will abort
# (causing release.sh to abort as well).  Same thing if there
# are any spurious extra entries here.
#
# Comments (lines beginning with #) and lines containing only
# whitespace are ignored.

###
### HOW TO SPECIFY COPYRIGHTS
###

# Models that were included in 3.0 are being handled an old way;
# there's a newer way for models that are new for 3.1 and future
# releases.
#
# OLD (3.0 AND PRIOR) MODELS:
# The copyright year is just copied from whatever the model already
# said (unless it was obviously grossly wrong).  The idea is not
# to rock the boat, since the existing copyright years may already
# have been cited in various places.
#
# NEW (3.1 AND FUTURE) MODELS:
# At the time you add the model here, attach the current year.
#
# SPECIAL HANDLING FOR CONVERTED STARLOGOT MODELS:
# Models converted from StarLogoT need two years specified: the
# original's copyright year (which becomes the NetLogo version's
# copyright year as well) and the year of conversion.  To determine
# the year of conversion, follow the same rules given above for
# 3.0-and-before versus 3.1-and-after.
#
# OTHER OPTIONS:
# You can add one of the following keywords to cause a model to be
# handled specially:
#  - specialCE      in Code Examples directory, but gets normal copyright
#  - MIT            created at MIT, Resnick ref
#  - Steiner        Creative Commons license, includes code by James Steiner
#  - MAC            credit the MAC grant
#  - NIELS          copyright & cite info both include Pratim
#  - ConChem        include how-to-cite info for the curriculum
#  - Stroup         copyright & cite info both include Walter
#  - Wilensky       created at MIT, Wilensky ref
#  - Cite           should always appear last and be followed by a colon and the
#                   names of the collaborators <lastname>, <firstinitial>.
#                   It is ok to add multiple names in a single line; see Erosion
#                   for example.  Uri need not be included; he will be added
#                   automatically at the end.
#  - 3D             3D models that were directly converted from existing 2D models
#                   They should already have the same name as the 2D model with 3D
#                   attached to the end.
