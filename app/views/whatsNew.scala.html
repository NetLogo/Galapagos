  <h2 id="v2.10.8">October 17th 2023 - v2.10.8</h2>

  <p>This release includes a few small improvements and fixes.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can now export HTML versions of a model from already-exported HTML files.</li>
    <li>Unbreeded agents will now render after breeded agents, matching desktop NetLogo's behavior.</li>
    <li>Any linked models you have edited that are in your browser local storage will be displayed in a list on the settings page so you can just right back in.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="v2.10.7">May 11th 2023 - v2.10.7</h2>

  <p>This small release includes a fix to get NetTango Web working correctly again.</p>

  <h2 id="v2.10.6">May 1st 2023 - v2.10.6</h2>

  <p>The primary feature in this release is <a href="settings">a user settings page</a>.  Now NetLogo Web users can set their preferred code and commands position, disable the work in progress autosave, and set their preferred language locale to something other than their browsers default.  We hope to add more settings for more features in the future.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The String extension is now supported in NetLogo Web.</li>
    <li>The <code>remove</code> reporter will no longer inadvertantly treat its pattern argument as a regular expression.</li>
    <li>Let the scatter plot performance boost apply in more cases.</li>
    <li>Prevent the scatter plot performance boost from applying to histograms where it does not help.</li>
    <li>Histogram plot display was changed slightly to try to make it legible with numerous thin columns.</li>
    <li>Fractional values are now allowed when editing plot axis minimums and maximums as well as pen intervals.</li>
    <li>Various ways to link to the same online model will now be treated identically for the work in progress autosave feature.</li>
    <li>Clarify which model source was used when loading a model with work in progress in the revert to original popup.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="v2.10.5">March 22nd 2023 - v2.10.5</h2>

  <p>This is a very small bugfix release that fixes the use of the plot export functions in our charting library.</p>

  <h2 id="v2.10.4">March 20th 2023 - v2.10.4</h2>

  <p>This release brings automatic saving of work in progress as you make changes to your models in NetLogo Web.  This autosave uses your browser's local cache so it doesn't require a server or account to use.  Each unique source of a model, a URL, a filename, or using New Model, is treated as a storage location for auto-save.  Returning to the same URL, re-uploading the model file, or going back to the New Model will get you right back to your work in progress with an option to revert to the original model if you prefer.  To try it out just <a href="launch#/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Slime.nlogo">open your favorite model</a> and <a href="docs/authoring">do some authoring</a>.  See <a href="docs/authoring#saving">the "Saving Your Changes" section</a> of the authoring docs for more information, including how to disable autosave when embedding models.  For safe keeping of models you put a lot of work into, we still recommend occasionally <a href="docs/faq#saving">downloading an <code>.nlogo</code> file locally to your computer</a>.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>Other features and improvements in this release:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Support translation of model runtime errors for simplified Chinese.  This is the first step towards supporting more languages in more parts of NetLogo Web.</li>
    <li>The link direction indicator will draw correctly when its shape does not include a middle line.</li>
    <li>For people embedding NetLogo Web models into other web pages or apps, we've added an event system that can be hooked into via JavaScript code to monitor model usage, along with a query system so information can be more easily pulled out of a model.  Full documentation of these features is coming.</li>
    <li>The rendering speed of scatter plots has been improved.</li>
    <li>We added some clarifying text on why some models that don't work yet in NetLogo Web are greyed out in the models library list.</li>
    <li>Improved the display of errors when a model completely fails to load.</li>
    <li>Fixed a few small bugs in NetTango Web.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="v2.10.3">December 20th 2022 - v2.10.3</h2>

  This is a small release with bugfixes and features.

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Bitmap-Extension#bitmap-extension-for-netlogo">The Bitmap extension</a> is now supported.  To get image data in base64 format into a NetLogo Web model for use by the Bitmap extension with <code>bitmap:from-base64</code>, see <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Fetch-Extension">the Fetch extension</a>.</li>
    <li>The Commands and Code position setting can now be <a href="docs/faq#tabs-parameter">determined by a URL query parameter when linking to NetLogo Web models</a>.</li>
    <li>Deleting a plot could cause unrecoverable errors.</li>
  </ul>

  It also includes <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetTango/wiki/Release-notes">some changes to NetTango Web</a>, including better support for right-to-left languages.

  <h2 id="v2.10.2">October 24th 2022 - v2.10.2</h2>

  This is a small release to fix a few different bugs.

  <ul>
    <li>The initial random-number generator seeds are now taken from the Crypto Web API, which should eliminate the chance multiple users can wind up with the same seed when they load a page.</li>
    <li>The <code>range</code> primitive will work when using the three-argument version.</li>
    <li>When you display an anonymous procedure as a string, it will include the names of <code>let</code> variables.</li>
    <li>Using a variable argument primitive like <code>word</code> concisely with <code>reduce</code> would give incorrect results.</li>
    <li>Saving a model to an nlogo file with a plot with blank axes names correctly sets the values to <code>NIL</code> so the file can be loaded without errors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="v2.10.1">August 9th 2022 - v2.10.1</h2>

  The major feature in this release is the ability to jump to the exact primitive in the code tab that causes a runtime error.  There are also a couple bug fixes:

  <ul>
    <li>The <code>random-exponential</code> reporter is now properly checked for runtime errors.</li>
    <li>The <code>random-normal</code> reporter is no longer broken as it was in v2.10.0.</li>
  </ul>

  It also includes <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetTango/wiki/Release-notes">some changes to NetTango Web</a>, including syntax highlighting in block code tips.

  <h2 id="v2.10.0">July 6th 2022 - v2.10.0</h2>

  <b>The major feature in this release is the ability to create and edit plot widgets in NetLogo Web!</b>  Check out <a href="docs/authoring">the Authoring mode documentation</a> for more information on creating and editing widgets.

  Bugfixes and other changes:

  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/FP-Extension">Functional Programming extension</a> is now supported on NetLogo Web.</li>
    <li>The Table extension now contains <code>to-json</code> and <code>from-json</code> primitives for converting to and from JSON strings.</li>
    <li>Primitives that take any kind of value (string, number, boolean, list, agent, agentset, etc) no longer check their argument types at runtime.  This should provide a small performance improvement for models that heavily use them (<code>lput</code> and <code>fput</code> are examples).</li>
    <li>Many more primitives and agent built-in variables have proper runtime error checks and will now generate meaningful error messages when an unexpected condition is encountered.</li>
    <li>When you get a runtime error message you can now easily copy it with the provided button.</li>
    <li>Fast-running models with large plots could sometimes stop updating and appear blank.  This has been corrected.</li>
    <li>We removed some methods to overwrite special JavaScript values using built-in primitives.</li>
    <li>The <code>error</code> primitive will properly generate stack traces.</li>
    <li>The <code>extract-rgb</code> primitive will work exactly the same as desktop NetLogo's version.</li>
    <li>The <code>tan</code> primitive will better handle asymptotic values.</li>
    <li>The <code>mod</code> primitive will check for an invalid zero divisor.</li>
    <li>The Encode extension will generate UTF-8 strings to match the desktop version's output.  Also, a bug was fixed where a stack overflow could occur with large strings.</li>
    <li>An exception could be generated when comparing links to turtles.</li>
    <li>Turtle stamp coloring should better match NetLogo desktop when transparency is used for the color.</li>
    <li>The model will not attempt to scroll itself into view when loaded.  This matters in the case where a model is embedded in an iframe that is not at the top of the containing page.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="v2.9.10">October 7th, 2021 - v2.9.10</h2>

  This release fixes bugs when using <code>let</code> variables in strings with <code>run</code> and <code>runresult</code>.

  It also includes <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetTango/wiki/Release-notes">many changes to NetTango Web</a>, including an improved help menu and access to NetLogo model variables in block expression attributes.

  Version 2.9.9 was a bugfix release for NetTango Web.

  <h2 id="v2.9.8">September 8th, 2021 - v2.9.8</h2>

  This release includes support for the new version of <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Palette-Extension">the Palette extension</a>.

  <h2 id="v2.9.6">July 19th, 2021 - v2.9.6</h2>

  Bugfixes and other changes:

  <ul>
    <li>When a monitor widget produced an agent value, the model would break when recompiled.</li>
    <li>When choosers, switches, and input widgets were added, their global variables could not be immediately referenced in the command console.</li>
    <li>When referencing an extension primitive that does not exist, the error message would not give the correct line number in code.</li>
    <li>The <code>wait</code> primitive could be used, but it's behavior was strange and it could potentially freeze NetLogo Web.  It's been updated to not wait any amount of time and to print a message about its lack of compatibility with NetLogo desktop.  <a href="docs/differences#wait">Read more info about why it differs from desktop in our docs.</a></li>
    <li>Some models in the library used <code>while [mouse-down?] [...]</code> which would cause NetLogo Web to freeze.  Those models have been updated to work with NetLogo Web.</li>
  </ul>

  This release also includes <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetTango/wiki/Release-notes">many changes to NetTango Web</a>, mostly around how the user interface is displayed.

  </ul>

  <h2 id="v2.8.4">March 3rd, 2021 - v2.8.4</h2>

  <p>This release adds support for the <code>plot-pen-up</code> primitive, adds better runtime error checks for agentset primitives and a few more math primitives, and fixes a small difference in model behavior from NetLogo desktop when using <code>n-of</code> with a list when <code>n</code> is the size of the list.</p>

  <h2 id="v2.8.3">February 8th, 2021 - v2.8.3</h2>

  <p>This small release fixes a bug that would cause runtime errors with the <code>up-to-n-of</code> primitive.</code></p>

  <h2 id="v2.8.2">January 20th, 2021 - v2.8.2</h2>

  <h3>Improvements and Bug Fixes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>NetLogo Web now supports checking the types of arguments for correctness given to math and list prims, and will give much more meaningful error messages when incorrect types are used.</li>
    <li>The plot auto-scale feature will only consider new data that is added to a plot, as it does on NetLogo desktop.  Previous it used all plot data a plot had seen to scale.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Models Library</h3>

  NetLogo Web has been updated with the same version of the Models Library that comes with NetLogo desktop 6.2.0, which means that many models have been added or modified.  See <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/versions.html#version-620-december-2020">the "Model Changes" section of the NetLogo version docs</a> for more information.

  <h2 id="v2.8.1">October 15th, 2020 - v2.8.1</h2>

  <h3>Improvements and Bug Fixes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Feature: The Array, NLMap, Matrix, and Table extensions can now export and import their extension objects with the <code>export-the:world</code> and <code>import-a:world</code> primitives.</li>
    <li>Bugfix: Recompiling a model that used the Array, NLMap, Matrix, or Table extensions could cause an error to occur that would leave the model unusable.</li>
    <li>Bugfix: Chooser widgets now properly retain their value between recompiles instead of reverting to the default choice from when the model was loaded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="v2.8.0">September 17th, 2020 - v2.8.0</h2>

  <h3>Improvements and Bug Fixes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Optimization: NetLogo Web now implements an optimized algorithm for <code>in-radius</code> and <code>in-cone</code>.  This should speed up models that use those primitives, especially with a radius argument great than 2.  Additionally, these optimizations mean the order agents from agentsets are returned will exactly match desktop's output.</li>
    <li>Optimization: The <code>random</code> and <code>count</code> primitives had small optimizations added for certain common use cases.</li>
    <li>Optimization: Commands run through the command center will be compiled much more quickly, so they should finish faster.</li>
    <li>Bugfix: The <code>layout-spring</code> primitive should work exactly like desktop in wrapped worlds.</li>
    <li>Bugfix: The <code>resize-world</code> primitive handles fractional arguments correctly.</li>
    <li>Bugfix: The <code>precision</code> primitive handles a fractional places argument correctly.</li>
    <li>Bugfix: A model will correctly recompile when a button is changed to a Forever type.</li>
    <li>Bugfix: Prevent runtime model exceptions from leaking out into the browser console.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>CSV Extension</h3>

  <p>The CSV extension is now officially supported in NetLogo Web.  Most of the primitives work the same as in <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/csv.html">the desktop version</a>, with the exception of the file-based primitives.  For getting CSV data from a file, see <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Fetch-Extension">the Fetch extension</a>.  For sending CSV data to a file, try out <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/SendTo-Extension">the SendTo extension</a>.</p>

  <h3>NetTango Web Builder</h3>

  <p>In addition to the above updates, there are also <a href="https://github.com/NetTango/NetTango/wiki/Release-notes">numerous bugfixes and improvements for the beta release of the NetTango Web Builder</a>, an application for creating block-based programming models with NetLogo Web. See <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/nettangoweb/tutorial">the NetTango Web Builder tutorial</a> for more information on using the NetTango Web Builder.</p>

  <li>Bugfix: Round first arg to <code>n-of</code> down as per NetLogo desktop</li>
  <li>Bugfix: Only calculate <code>sum</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>min</code> and <code>standard-deviation</code> on numbers from lists, and improve error messages for all numerical list calculation prims.</li>
  <li>Parity: Rename Label widgets to Note widgets to match desktop</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>New Extensions</h3>

  <p>These new extensions are thanks to the hard work of Center for Connected Learning summer intern Xuan Zhang.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>The Array extension is now supported.</li>
  <li>The Matrix extension is now supported. The primitives <code>real-eigenvalues</code>, <code>imaginary-eigenvalues</code>, and <code>eigenvectors</code> are not yet implemented and will throw runtime errors if used.</li>

  <h2 id="may24th2019-v2.6.0">May 24th, 2019 - v2.6.0</h2>

  <h3>Input and Output Extensions</h3>

  <p>The major new features for this release of NetLogo Web are new extensions that enable sending input to and pulling output from outside the browser session. Almost all of these extensions also have a matching NetLogo desktop version, which means you can write a single model that uses external files or data that runs nearly identically in both environments.</p>

  <p>Here is a listing of each of the new extensions with links to their documentation, why you might want to use them, and the desktop primitive functionality they are meant to provide.</p>

  <table>

  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Why not just reproduce the same input and output primitives that NetLogo desktop uses in web? The reasons are technical, but NetLogo Web's design along with the limitations of the browser environment it runs in makes duplicating the exact functionality of the desktop primitives impossible. In the web environment we do not control when the browser will finish getting input we request from a file, a URL, or even from the user, so we usually need to provide <em>callback procedures</em> that can run once the browser complete.  Rather than making primitives whose behavior would differ between platforms, we decided to make extensions whose behavior would be identical between NetLogo desktop and NetLogo Web. The <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Dialog-Extension#what-problem-does-this-extension-solve"><strong>Dialog</strong> extension document has more details on the issue</a> if you are interested.</p>

  <p>As part of these updates, the way to do <code>import-world</code> and <code>import-drawing</code> has changed! Instead of using those primitives, the new <strong>ImportA</strong> extension provides the <code>import-a:world</code> primitive that reads a world from a string.  Use <code>export-the:world</code> to get your model's world data as a string, or the <strong>Fetch</strong> extension to get it from outside of your model.  The <strong>Fetch</strong> provides a <code>fetch:user-file-async</code> primitive that will prompt the user to select a file, and then send that file's contents to the provided procedure to use with <code>import-a:world</code>.</p>

  <p>You can see an example below, and would use a similar process for <code>import-a:drawing</code> or the new <code>import-a:pcolors</code> primitive that provides the <code>import-pcolors</code> functionality from desktop.  There are more examples in <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/ImportA-Extension">the docs for the <strong>ImportA</strong> extension</a>.</p>

  <pre><code>
  extensions [ fetch import-a ]

  to import-world-new
    fetch:user-file-async [ world-file -&gt;
      import-a:world world-file

      ; if you have code that needs to run after
      ; the world import, it should go here
    ]
  end
  </code></pre>

  <h3>Features and Improvements</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>The included models have been updated to match those in the NetLogo desktop 6.1 release. See <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/versions.html#model-changes">the NetLogo desktop 6.1 release notes</a> for more information on those changes.</li>
  <li>The new multiple-condition behavior for the <code>ifelse</code> and <code>ifelse-value</code> primitives is supported. See <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#ifelse">the NetLogo dictionary</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>The new <code>up-to-n-of</code> primitive for selecting random elements from agentsets and lists without an error when the result is smaller than requested is now supported.

  <h3>Coding Enhancements</h3>

  <p>As part of Google Summer of Code a trio of improvements were made to the coding experience of NetLogo Web:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A "Jump to Procedure" dropdown has been added in the NetLogo Code tab that makes it easy to go right to a procedure definition in the code.</li>
    <li>A "Show Usage" hotkey has been added - simply highlight some text and hit <code>Ctrl-U</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Command-U</code> (macOS) and you'll see a list of the lines of code the text is used. This is very useful for finding where variables and procedures are used.</li>
    <li>An "Auto-Complete" feature has been added. When the checkbox is checked in the NetLogo Code tab, suggestions for keywords, primitives, and procedure names will popup as you type in code.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Three more features were added that should also help the coding and model testing experience:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A "Comment Code" hotkey has been added that will toggle a line between commented or uncommented with the <code>;</code> character. Useful for quickly testing code with or without some line. It is available at <code>Ctrl-;</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Command-;</code> (macOS).</li>
    <li>There is an option to move the "Commands and Code" tabs to the right side of the screen, instead of the bottom (the default). This allows viewing the Command Center or NetLogo Code tabs side-by-side with a model, which is much nicer on wide screens.</li>
    <li>Errors that occur as a result of code typed into the Command Center will now show in the Command Center display, instead of in a dialog box. The Command Center is also more consistent about retaining focus after commands are entered.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Improvements and Bug Fixes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Wide models will now expand to take up more screen space by default, instead of getting "stuck" inside a small box on the screen.</li>
    <li>Lots of improvements to navigating models in the models library dropdown - using browser back and forward buttons should work much more reliably.</li>
    <li>Workarounds were added to better support the Microsoft Edge web browser, especially around widget editing.</li>
    <li>The Baby BehaviorSpace experimental feature is now aware of the <code>behaviorspace-expiriment-name</code> and <code>behaviorspace-run-number</code> primitives.</li>
    <li>Fixed a couple issues and styles for the documentation pages.</li>
    <li>Turtle pen size choices are now better respected.</li>
    <li>The same <code>nlogo</code> file can now be uploaded multiple times in a row - before nothing would happen on the 2nd or further uploads.</li>
    <li>Monitor widgets allow non-numeric values, as in desktop.</li>
    <li>Models that use <code>inspect</code> can now compile and run, but the command doesn't do anything.</li>
    <li>More primitives have been added to the code highlighter.</li>
    <li>Fix for using <code>turtle-set</code> with special agentsets, like <code>turtles</code> and <code>patches</code>. It wasn't making a new agentset in these cases, so adjustments to the new agentset would affect all agents in the world.</li>
    <li>Improved error messages for <code>n-of</code> to match desktop.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where using <code>setxy</code> with <code>pen-down</code> and a wrapped world wouldn't properly wrap the pen drawings.</li>
    <li>Exporting anonymous procedures works with <code>export-world</code> without errors. Note that importing is not supported (in desktop or web).</li>
    <li>Speed optimizations were added around breed checks for agents, the <code>patchat</code> primitive, and using commands or reporters with large agentsets, like <code>patches</code> in a big world.</li>
    <li>The <code>item</code> primitive now allows non-integer indexes when accessing a list, just like desktop.</li>
    <li>Errors are thrown when using <code>ask</code> or <code>inspect</code> with a dead agent, as with desktop.</li>
    <li>Using <code>towards</code> with patches no longer throws an error.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>NetLogo 6 Parity</h3>

  Much has been done to keep step with the desktop version of NetLogo as it transitioned from version 5.3.1 to version 6.0.0.  The two most significant changes have been making link primitives more consistent with one another in their behavior, and the replacement of tasks with anonymous procedures.  For more information about these items, please see the "Tasks replaced by Anonymous Procedures" and "Link reporters overhauled to be more consistent and flexible" subsections of <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/transition.html#v60">the NetLogo 6 transition guide</a>.

  <h3>Models Library</h3>

  NetLogo Web is now using the version of the Models Library that comes with NetLogo 6, which means that many models have been added or modified.  See the "Models" section <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/versions.html">here</a> for more information.

  <h3>Newly-Implemented Language Primitives</h3>

  <p>First and foremost, this update brings with it the implementation of many
     NetLogo primitives, substantially increasing the percentage of the

    <li>with-min</li>
    <li>with-max</li>
    <li>wrap-color</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Updated Models Library</h3>

  <p>This change adds the Traffic Basic Adaptive Individuals model and updates
     dozens of other models were updated with small tweaks and code style
     improvements.</p>

  <p>The above changes, combined with all of the new primitives added, has
     allowed the following models to now be openable in NetLogo Web:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Autumn</li>
    <li>Bacteria Food Hunt</li>
    <li>Bacteria Hunt Speeds</li>
    <li>BeeSmart Hive Finding</li>
    <li>Bug Hunt Coevolution</li>
    <li>Bug Hunt Speeds</li>
    <li>Connected Chemistry Gas Combustion</li>
    <li>Connected Chemistry Rusting Reaction</li>
    <li>Connected Chemistry Solid Combustion</li>
    <li>Current in a Wire</li>
    <li>Dice Stalagmite</li>
    <li>Disease Solo</li>
    <li>DNA Replication Fork</li>
    <li>Echo</li>
    <li>El Farol Network Congestion</li>
    <li>epiDEM Basic</li>
    <li>epiDEM Travel and Control</li>
    <li>Equidistant Probability</li>
    <li>Fireworks</li>
    <li>Flocking - Alternative Visualizations</li>
    <li>Flocking Vee Formations</li>
    <li>GasLab Single Collision</li>
    <li>Geometron Top-Down</li>
    <li>HSB and RGB Example</li>
    <li>K-Means Clustering</li>
    <li>Lightning</li>
    <li>Lunar Lander</li>
    <li>Many Regions Example</li>
    <li>Muscle Development</li>
    <li>Osmotic Pressure</li>
    <li>Particle Swarm Optimization</li>
    <li>Particle System Flame</li>
    <li>Particle System Fountain</li>
    <li>Particle System Waterfall</li>
    <li>Plant Speciation</li>
    <li>Prob Graphs Basic</li>
    <li>Random Basic Advanced</li>
    <li>Reactor Top Down</li>
    <li>Red Queen</li>
    <li>Sampler Solo</li>
    <li>Shuffle Board</li>
    <li>Simple Economy.nlogo</li>
    <li>Stochastic Patchwork</li>
    <li>Sunflower Biomorphs</li>
    <li>Traffic Basic Adaptive Individuals</li>
    <li>Turtles Circling</li>
    <li>Urban Suite - Path Dependence</li>
    <li>Urban Suite - Recycling</li>
    <li>Vision Cone Example</li>
    <li>Voronoi</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note: While most of these work fine, the fact that a model is openable does
     not imply that we think the model is running well.  Some of these models
     are still a bit slow or buggy, and we plan to fix that in future updates.</p>

  <h3>New Random Number Generator</h3>

  <p>Previously, NetLogo Web used the standard JavaScript random number
     generator.  With this update, NetLogo Web now gets its random numbers from
     a direct port of the random number generator used in desktop NetLogo.
     Thanks to this, any seed passed to <code>random-seed</code> leads to
     exactly the same model run in NetLogo Web as it does in desktop NetLogo.</p>
