# This exists to address some trickiness.  Here are the relevant constraints:
#
#   1. HTML color pickers have higher color space resolution than the NetLogo color system
#   2. The color picker must be automatically updated when a color value updates in the engine
#   3. The engine must be automatically updated when a new color is chosen
#
# The logical solution for (2) and (3) is to do the normal two-way binding that we do for the all other
# NetLogo variables.  However, if we do that, the new color will be continually clobbered by the one from
# the engine, since the picker won't get updated until the color picker is closed (and you'll never close it,
# except out of frustration from the fact that your color choice is getting clobbered).  So, okay, we use
# `on-input` instead of `on-change` to update the color before closing the picker.  But then (1) comes into
# play.
#
# So you have this enormous space for visually choosing colors--tens of thousands of points.  However,
# only maybe 20 of those points are valid NetLogo colors.  So, with the variables bound together, you
# pick a color in the picker, and then the picker jumps to the nearest NetLogo-expressible color (which can
# be a pretty far jump).  NetLogo just keeps doing this, ad infinitum.  The user experience feels awful.
# So the solution that I've chosen here is to establish kind of a buffer zone, so that we only update the
# picker when a new value comes in from the engine.
